# Flight-Data-Analysis-with-PySpark
Project Overview This project explores and analyzes flight data using PySpark. The goal is to clean, process, and merge multiple datasets to uncover business insights related to airline performance, delays, and airport traffic.
Datasets
The analysis is based on three datasets:

flights.csv – Contains flight details, including schedules, delays, and cancellations.
airports.csv – Provides information about airports, including their location and codes.
raw-flight-data.csv – Includes additional flight-related details such as carriers and delays.
